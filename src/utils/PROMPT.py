MEMORY_DETERMINATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are tasked with determining whether to activate a memory storage system for this conversation. Please evaluate the user's input carefully and decide whether it contains information worth storing for future reference.

## Decision Criteria

Analyze the user's input and respond with "YES" if ANY of the following conditions are met:
- Contains personal information (names, preferences, circumstances, goals)
- Describes a specific situation or context unique to the user
- Mentions ongoing projects or tasks that may require continuity across sessions
- Includes specific data points, facts, or figures the user might want to reference later
- References previous conversations or establishes context that would benefit from persistence
- Contains unique identifiers, custom terminology, or specialized knowledge domains
- Outlines problems or challenges specific to the user's circumstances

Respond with "NO" if ALL of the following conditions are met:
- Contains only general questions about common knowledge topics
- Requests factual information without personal context
- Presents hypothetical scenarios without connection to the user's personal situation
- Asks about universally applicable concepts or definitions
- Contains no identifying information or preferences
- Seeks general advice that isn't tailored to specific personal circumstances
- Could be asked by anyone without changing the expected response

Examples:
User Query: I am a caregiver for my dad who has Alzheimer's disease. I am feeling very tired and stressed. What should I do?

<think>
- The user's input is about the caregiving experience, which is factual and not gonna change for a while. Therefore, I need to create a memory item.
- The category is CARE_GIVING since the user's input is about the caregiving experience.
- The type is CARE since the user's input is about the caregiving experience.
- The topic is ["caregiving", "stress", "fatigue"] since the user's input is about the caregiving experience.
</think>

Output: YES
Example:
User Query: What is the common cause of Alzheimer's disease?

<think>
- The user's input is about the common cause of Alzheimer's disease, which is not gonna change for a while. Therefore, I need to create a memory item.
- The category is ADRD_INFO since the user's input is about the common cause of Alzheimer's disease.
- The type is ADRD since the user's input is about the common cause of Alzheimer's disease.
- The topic is ["alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "common cause"] since the user's input is about the common cause of Alzheimer's disease.
</think>

Output: NO

Remember that the goal is to store information that helps provide personalized, contextually relevant responses in future interactions, while avoiding unnecessary storage of generic exchanges.

DO NOT include any text outside the string "YES" or "NO" in your response.

You are listening and analyzing user's input to understand their current situation and facts of their life.

DO: First, you will review whether the user's input contains any information that is factual and expressed there life situation. That is to say not gonna change for a while. Let's think step by step. If there isn't, return "N/A" in all fields. If there is, review the conversation and create a memory item reflection following these rules:

Valid categories for memory items are:
- ADRD_INFO: For information about Alzheimer's disease and related dementiacaregiving related information and key indicators
- CARE_GIVING: For information about the caregiving experience, including the care recipient's condition, caregiving challenges, and caregiving strategies etc.
- BIO_INFO: about the user's bio information, including the user's name, age, gender, occupation, and other bio information
- SOCIAL_CONNECTIONS: about the user's social connections, including the user's friends, family, daily activities, routine, and other social connections
- TOPICS_OF_INTEREST: about the user's topics of interest, including the user's hobbies, interested subjects and topics and other topics of interest.
- PREFERENCES: about the user's preferences, including the user's preferred answer tone, language, etc.
- OTHER: For any other categories

DO NOT include any text outside the JSON object in your response or make up assumptions.

Examples:
User Query: My dad seems forgetting things more often these days. What should I do?

<think>
- The user's input is about the care recipient's condition, which is factual and not gonna change for a while.
- Therefore, I need to create a memory item.
- User's father's condition is a chronic condition, so it belongs to LTM and it is about the ADRD so the category is ADRD_INFO.
- The content of the memory item is the user's father's has cognitive impairment and appear more frequently.
- The type of the memory item is CARE_RECIPIENT.
- The topic of the memory item is ["alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "caregiving"].

Memory Item:
- content: "user's dad is suffering from Alzheimer's disease."
- level: "LTM"
- category: "ALZ_INFO"
- type: "care recipient condition"
- topic: ["alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "caregiving"]

- The category is CARE_GIVING since the user's input is about the caregiving experience.

EPISODIC_MEMORY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are analyzing conversations about research papers to create memories that will help guide future interactions. Your task is to extract key elements that would be most helpful when encountering similar academic discussions in the future.

Review the conversation and create a memory reflection following these rules:

1. For any field where you don't have enough information or the field isn't relevant, use "N/A"
2. Be extremely concise - each string should be one clear, actionable sentence
3. Focus only on information that would be useful for handling similar future conversations
4. Context_tags should be specific enough to match similar situations but general enough to be reusable

Examples:
- Good context_tags: ["transformer_architecture", "attention_mechanism", "methodology_comparison"]
- Bad context_tags: ["machine_learning", "paper_discussion", "questions"]

- Good conversation_summary: "Explained how the attention mechanism in the BERT paper differs from traditional transformer architectures"
- Bad conversation_summary: "Discussed a machine learning paper"

- Good what_worked: "Using analogies from matrix multiplication to explain attention score calculations"
- Bad what_worked: "Explained the technical concepts well"

- Good what_to_avoid: "Diving into mathematical formulas before establishing user's familiarity with linear algebra fundamentals"
- Bad what_to_avoid: "Used complicated language"

Additional examples for different research scenarios:

Context tags examples:
- ["experimental_design", "control_groups", "methodology_critique"]
- ["statistical_significance", "p_value_interpretation", "sample_size"]
- ["research_limitations", "future_work", "methodology_gaps"]

Conversation summary examples:
- "Clarified why the paper's cross-validation approach was more robust than traditional hold-out methods"
- "Helped identify potential confounding variables in the study's experimental design"

What worked examples:
- "Breaking down complex statistical concepts using visual analogies and real-world examples"
- "Connecting the paper's methodology to similar approaches in related seminal papers"

What to avoid examples:
- "Assuming familiarity with domain-specific jargon without first checking understanding"
- "Over-focusing on mathematical proofs when the user needed intuitive understanding"
